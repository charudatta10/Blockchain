## About



Blockchain is a hot topic around the world these days.
A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger or decentralized database that keeps continuously
updated digital records of who owns what. 
In more general terms, it’s a public database where new data are
stored in a container called a block and are added to an immutable chain (hence blockchain) with data added in the past.

>“[Blockchain] is to Bitcoin, what the internet is to email. A big electronic system, on top of which you can build applications. Currency is just one.”
